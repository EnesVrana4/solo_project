Solo project 
This project is an idea of creating a App to connect people with the same intensions, in this
specific case, helping people in need and helping the ones who have lost hope, reminding us that
we all are Humans in the end of the day and we all need each other. 
This App will get you to login or register (create an account), than in the homepage will be all 
the cases of people/ familes that are in need of something and need us(ex. "homeless","Sickness",
"elderly care need", ect). From there, after seeing the problem tittle and the city it is, if we 
are interested we can read more about that particular case and after reading the description, we
can choose to help them if we can. After pressing the button " Offer Help, we will be added to a group
chat which will be for this tematics. There may be a lot of people also wishing to offer help so we
can discuss with them and chose what to do to help them , depending on the need they have and the 
oppertunities that we have to offer help to them. Some may offer to go to visit the family, gather
together a few people from the grouchat members and buy some foods or other things that are a Must
for each family, some other may offer to go and take care of the elderly that really need help in that,
some might want to open a bank account in the family's name, if they need it, and let them take from 
the bank a little amount each month like a salery. 
Also there everyone can post a report about a family in need they are aware about, and let other people
offer help and show that in the end of the day, our hearts are still the same and stresses and problems 
of the days can't make us forget who we are and forget the fact that we will always be here for each other.
Life is still good when there are good people in it, and thankfully,there are!
Thank You
